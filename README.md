# Inkblaster

A UWP drawing/notetaking app based heavily on Windows Ink. The goal is speed and simplicity so that glitches and your ever-dying battery don't distract from just taking notes.

## Basic usage
Inkblaster is still an alpha-level app and hasn't yet been extensively tested! Nevertheless:

Open ink toolbar by pressing the pen barrel button. Otherwise, just take notes! If you need more canvas space, press the `+` button to add more. Everything should work more or less how you would expect.
